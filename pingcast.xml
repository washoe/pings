<rss version = "2.0"><channel><title>PINGcast rss feed</title><description>PINGS springs directly from the geographical distance between two collaborators. Working directly from their locales they explore the physical space between them through rivers and air and a range of other terrains with their own qualities, such as the web, phone, post, and the less tangible links of memory and synchronicity. In January 2008 the artists began an exchange of performance and materials through these various channels as a means of mapping these terrains.mp4ement artist Simon Whitehead and Sound artist Barnaby Oliver have been working simultaneously from their local rivers in Abercych, west Wales and Melbourne, Australia. Although a few thousand miles apart they share the intention to meet at a particular time each week and approach their rivers as an unbroken body of water through which they correspond. Their instincts are improvisational and over time they have been building a body of performative material from these shared events. Linked by their shared intentions and the physical rivers this material (in video, sound and image) begins to create its own character responsive to season, the time of day, the level of water and the meandering presence of each artist. This unedited material is shared through the net and snail mail and the artists now invite you to subscribe to these events through podcast, email and post. See www.untitledstates.net/pings for more information. Barnaby Oliver and Simon Whitehead have been collaborating for over 12 years. Their online resource www.untitledstates.net  elaborates on their work, past and present. PINGS is funded by an Artsadmin (London) Roaming Bursary.</description><language>en-au</language><link>http://www.untitledstates.net/pings</link><image><title>PINGcast rss feed</title><url>assets/img/ping%201.1.JPG</url><link>http://www.untitledstates.net/pings</link></image><item><title>Ping 71: Dulais (simon whitehead) - Wed, 07 Jan 2009 20:57:49 +0000</title><link>assets/ping.php?id=71</link><description>minus 10</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2009 20:57:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="assets/enclosures/pingice.mp4"  length="4402874"  type="video/quicktime"/></item><item><title>Ping 70: Dulais (simon whitehead) - Tue, 30 Dec 2008 15:28:09 +0000</title><link>assets/ping.php?id=70</link><description>30 December. 11am.

crossing the river..

watching a large branch becoming caught in the bank,
counter to the flow it creates turbulence in itself and the
water around it. It remains in this state of balanced tension, oscillating beautifully.

It is stuck, but it seems that this is a transitory state, a balance, the branch is likely to become untethered at any moment..

approach the river,
the smell of fox again,
a woodpecker in a tree.

water low, calm, green
wade to the eddies by the
big meander,
balance the guitar in the ash tree,
rest the neck on the riverbed.
the water plays the strings, there are
different surges and frequencies in the
volume of water.

i approach the guitar through the water,
the turbulence i create changes the sound.
i play the copper pipe into the water close to
the machine heads, the strings pick up the vibration.

i have borrowed my friend Ade's waders,
when i enter the river i feel the strange weight of the water compress me
and the way i move is in relation to the volume and
movement of water around me ..unstable, like dancing before
i can walk...</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Feb 2008 13:21:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="assets/enclosures/ping16s.mp3"  length="6916805"  type="audio/x-mp3"/></item><item><title>Ping 15: maribyrnong (barnaby oliver) - Thu, 28 Feb 2008  10:43:28 +0000</title><link>assets/ping.php?id=15</link><description>Cold wind i draw in the dust with guitar then strum quietly</description><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2008  10:43:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="assets/enclosures/ping15b.mp3"  length="3825579"  type="audio/x-mp3"/></item><item><title>Ping 14: abercych (simon whitehead) - Wed, 20 Feb 2008 10:55:00 +0000</title><link>assets/ping.php?id=14</link><description>strong smell of fox, a newly killed pheasant, river low and  green,
