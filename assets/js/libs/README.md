Twitter's bootstrap - minified
==============================

The minifed version of Twitter's Bootstrap.

This is a simple fork of [Twitter's Bootstrap repo](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap), but without the LESS, docs and the rest.

It was created for me to simply clone it into my projects, instead of downloading the archived version (which is simple enough, but still).

This way it saves me the Twitter's repo history size to download (at the moment the size is a bit more than 10MB) and the make.

I'll try and maintain it to be up to date with the Twitter's.
